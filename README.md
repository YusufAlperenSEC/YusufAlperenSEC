## Introduction ðŸš€
<p>
Cyber security, software development, servers, providing technical support... I love them all!<br>
I am a university student that has a lot of passion and enthusiasm towards Information Technology and its fields.

I've gained a lot of knowledge between different fields with my passion-driven approach.
I learned to use Linux and all the other distributions for their intended purpose.

The first Linux distribution I've used was Kali Linux. I learned numerous techniques with the training and realistic scenarios I've faced.

The knowledge that you acquire from penetration testing allows you to develop safer apps, protect your data and so on.

I also learned developing software with Qt Framework.

## Other Hobbies ðŸŽ¾
<p>
I have a lot of hobbies; and when I say "I have a lot of hobbies", I mean it ðŸ™‚<br>
Besides IT, I did music production, sim-flying and sim-racing, high quality audio researching and etc.<br>
Even though I don't do them often, I still love these hobbies.

I did music production with FL Studio for a long time. And because I improved my ear by making music (and listening to other projects made by other producers), I started researching about how an audio system can get better than any of the sound systems that we have lying around. There are a lot of technical terms that you gotta learn before buying a high-end headphone or a speaker system. It may seem a bit intimidating, but that's actually the most fun part.

I always loved airplanes and cars; but when I discovered about realistic simulation software, my passion for cars and airplanes increased. Just like how I did with audio, I put myself through different challenges and scenarios to learn more about flying and driving. And shockingly, they actually do help in real-life.
